[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rakyll/boom.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rakyll/boom)

Boom is a tiny program that sends some load to a web application. It's similar to Apache Bench ([ab](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html)), but with better availability across different platforms and a less troubling installation experience.

Boom is originally written by Tarek Ziade in Python and is available on [tarekziade/boom](https://github.com/tarekziade/boom). But, due to its dependency requirements and my personal annoyance of maintaining concurrent programs in Python, I decided to rewrite it in Go.

## Installation

Simple as it takes to type the following command:

    go get github.com/rakyll/boom

## Usage

Boom supports custom headers, request body and basic authentication. It runs provided number of requests in the provided concurrency level, and prints stats.
~~~
Usage: boom [options...] <url>

Options:
  -n  Number of requests to run.
  -c  Number of requests to run concurrently. Total number of requests cannot
      be smaller than the concurency level.
  -q  Rate limit, in seconds (QPS).
  -o  Output type. If none provided, a summary is printed.
      "csv" is the only supported alternative. Dumps the response
      metrics in comma-seperated values format.

  -m  HTTP method, one of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS.
  -H  Custom HTTP header. You can specify as many as needed by repeating the flag.
      for example, -H "Accept: text/html" -H "Content-Type: application/xml" .
  -t  Timeout in ms.
  -A  HTTP Accept header.
  -d  HTTP request body.
  -T  Content-type, defaults to "text/html".
  -a  Basic authentication, username:password.
  -x  HTTP Proxy address as host:port.

  -readall              Consumes the entire request body.
  -allow-insecure       Allow bad/expired TLS/SSL certificates.

  -cert  SSL client certificate.
  -key   SSL client private key.
  -disable-compression  Disable compression.
  -disable-keepalive    Disable keep-alive, prevents re-use of TCP
                        connections between different HTTP requests.
  -cpus                 Number of used cpu cores.
                        (default for current machine is 1 cores)
